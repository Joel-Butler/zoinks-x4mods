This is a mid to endgame quality of life enhancement that I've made mainly to simplify the way I like to game. It might be helpful for others or might be a useful building block for additional QOL features that fit your playstyle. Please feel free to use what I've figured out as a platform for anything you'd like to improve/enhance.
